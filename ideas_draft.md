## Syntax and semantics


--------------

Currently, what is between the opening token and the first following
space is the name of the block. I'm wondering how bad it would be, in
order to avoid that "mandatory space", to consider that names can't be
builtin names.  That would allow the space to be optional.

In this context, it would mean that builtin names are sort of keywords...
