The MPP-language-blender/implementation folder contains the implementation part of MPP.

MPP is written in OCaml.

If you sent me an email and I didn't reply within a day, it probably means that I didn't get it and you should send it to me again (by hitting "reply" on your email app).

This file will be changed shortly, as MPP is actually born.
